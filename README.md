# Video Stabilization

This repository contains a digital video stabilization system. The system is based on computer vision
techniques, including but not limited to feature extraction, optical flow, etc. The stabilizer has two modes: 
it can stabilize user-provided video when the mode flag is set to 'video' and can operate on real-time 
video streams if the mode flag is 'live'. The post written by Abhishek Singh Thakur, which can be 
found [here](https://learnopencv.com/video-stabilization-using-point-feature-matching-in-opencv/),
helps a lot on this project. This project can be considered an improvement of the system described in the post.
